# üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview: Halo

## Project Summary

**Halo** is a lightweight, futuristic Chrome Extension that acts as a user's *ambient second brain*. It provides a persistent, minimal sidebar across all websites, allowing users to quickly capture notes, tasks, and reminders without losing browsing context. Halo is designed to enhance focus, creativity, and retention by keeping thoughts easily accessible at all times.

## Key Goals

- Deliver an always-available, non-intrusive **sidebar** UI.
- Allow users to **capture notes and tasks instantly**, optionally tied to their current URL.
- Focus on **local-first storage** for privacy and speed (no required signups initially).
- Build with a clean, elegant, accessible frontend (WCAG-compliant).
- Ship a **functional MVP within 1‚Äì2 weeks**.

## Target User

- Knowledge workers, creators, developers, researchers, and power internet users.
- Users who juggle many tabs, ideas, and projects.
- Users who want a *private, fast, seamless* thought capture tool ‚Äî not a heavy productivity app.
